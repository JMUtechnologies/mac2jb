# Vendored upstream components

The pinned source revisions and project URLs are listed in `../upstream.lock`.
The MIT licenses and APSL 2.0 license texts are retained alongside the relevant
source files. Root `LICENSE` does not override third-party terms.

- **libusbd:** based on the upstream revision in `upstream.lock`, with dated
  downstream changes in `Makefile` and `src/plat/macos/impl.c`, plus a
  **2026-10-26** IOKit service-handle ownership fix in
  `src/plat/macos/alt_IOUSBDeviceControllerLib.c`. The wrapper retains its own
  service reference and balances its release; the original author credits and
  licenses remain. The pin records the upstream origin, not an unmodified tree.
- **macos_usb_gadget_poc:** intentionally trimmed upstream source. Contains
  `usbgadget/` (MIT-licensed kernel extension source and Xcode project), plus
  provenance README and APSL text. The unused `usb_device/` proof of concept,
  upstream convenience shell scripts, prebuilt `usbgadget.kext/`, and machine-local
  Xcode user settings are excluded. This is **not** a byte-for-byte upstream tree.
- **ns2jb:** the `kurumuz` fork, based on pepsipu's
  original project, replaces the previous runtime. Its complete snapshot and
  tests are pinned in `upstream.lock`. All runtime, exploit, and test files are
  unchanged. `SHA256SUMS` is regenerated over the actual snapshot because the
  fork's manifest has 14 stale hashes and omits added files. Its original
  manifest is retained in `packaging/ns2jb-eb2bdec-SHA256SUMS.upstream`.
  `assets/bootstrap.bas` is copied byte for byte from the fork, including its
  five-argument START interface. `scripts/prepare-bootstrap.cjs` copies and
  checks that exact asset; no compatibility transformation is applied. The
  wrappers and senders use the five-argument command. Previously saved
  nine-argument NS2 programs must be replaced before testing this build.
  Any redistributor must establish their
  own rights to ship it; a Git URL or public availability alone is not a license.

Do not run `scripts/freeze-upstream.sh` in a normal user installation. It is a
maintainer-only source refresh requiring a new provenance, license and security
review before publication.
